## Note

This probably won't bother many but this code won't always be updated after a certain point. That point being if this project were to make it onto Steam or something.

## Description

This repo will simply serve to house some of the scripts I use in my Unity project that emulates the original Freelancer.
The physics do not properly match the original but they do recreate a non-Newtownian ship that greatly resembles the original's movement.

I've been working on this project for quite sometime, about 2 years ago I began working on it in Unreal 4.18(?) solely in Blueprints. This version was super hard to maintain and it quickly fell apart. I horrificly demonstrated my botched knowledge of OO-design and no longer have the source for that version. Relics of that stage can be viewed on my YouTube. That being said, that version is incredibly beautiful for just basically dropping Freelancer's assets in the Unreal engine with a custom skybox. 

## Development

#### [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/tgyAz2pZ)

#### [Youtube Devblog Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLJBwf54kzZ-DsLQSUhFRbUjZXIO6FOq_4)

## [Builds (itch.io)](https://tsny.itch.io/project-lonestar)

Infrequently I will update the itch.io page that contains the project's builds
Expect this to not be updated very often if a lot more work appears on the project.
In its current state there is no story or gameplay.

## What the project used to look like 

Originally the project was worked on in Unreal and looked pretty great like I mentioned above...

[Here's a really pretty video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATOh75c0bQc&index=19&list=PLJBwf54kzZ-DsLQSUhFRbUjZXIO6FOq_4&t=0s)
