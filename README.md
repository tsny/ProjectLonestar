Project Lonestar is a space sim with an emphasis on exploration and combat. 
It is also a spiritual successor to and heavily based upon [Freelancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NODc1lXn0ak).
It is currently in development for PC using Unity.

## History

I've been working on this project for quite sometime, about 2 years ago I began working on it in Unreal 4.18(?) solely in Blueprints. This version was super hard to maintain and it quickly fell apart. I horrificly demonstrated my botched knowledge of OO-design and no longer have the source for that version. Relics of that stage can be viewed on my YouTube. That being said, that version is really pretty for just basically dropping Freelancer's assets in the Unreal engine with a custom skybox.

[Here's a really pretty video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATOh75c0bQc&index=19&list=PLJBwf54kzZ-DsLQSUhFRbUjZXIO6FOq_4&t=0s)
